:memo: Our paper [Unified Software Engineering agent as AI Software Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14683) has been accepted to ICSE'26.
We introduce USEagent (Unified Software Engineering agent) that is capable of handling a broad spectrum of software engineering tasks.
USEagent achieves this versatility through top-down <i>action abstraction</i> grounded in established software engineering practices.
