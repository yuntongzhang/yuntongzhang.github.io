Hello, I am Yuntong Zhang (张云彤). Welcome to my home page.

I'm currently a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), advised by Prof. [Abhik Roychoudhury](https://abhikrc.com/).

I'm generally intereted in topics related to improving quality and security guarantees of software systems. My current research focus is on leveraging artifacts produced during software testing process to repair security vulnerabilities. I have also previously worked on software sanitizers and binary analysis.

Feel free to send me email if you would like to have a chat! :smile:

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
