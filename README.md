Personal webpage built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.


## Setup

### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*). Clone this repo and do:

```bash
$ git clone <this-repo>
$ cd <repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

1. Rename your repository to `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
2. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
3. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
4. Make changes, commit, and push!
5. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

**To enable automatic deployment:**
1. Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.
2. Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.
3. Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `master` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch.
4. Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `master`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).



## Some features

### Publications

Your publications page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography.
Simply edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing `_pages/publications.md`.

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Author annotation:</strong></summary>

In publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in `_config.yml`:
```
scholar:
  last_name: Einstein
  first_name: [Albert, A.]
```
If the entry matches the last name and one form of the first names, it will be underlined.
Keep meta-information about your co-authors in `_data/coauthors.yml` and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically.
The coauthor data format in `_data/coauthors.yml` is as follows,
```
"Adams":
  - firstname: ["Edwin", "E.", "E. P.", "Edwin Plimpton"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams

"Podolsky":
  - firstname: ["Boris", "B.", "B. Y.", "Boris Yakovlevich"]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky

"Rosen":
  - firstname: ["Nathan", "N."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen

"Bach":
  - firstname: ["Johann Sebastian", "J. S."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach

  - firstname: ["Carl Philipp Emanuel", "C. P. E."]
    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach
```
If the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided.

</details>

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Buttons (through custom bibtex keywords):</strong></summary>

There are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:

- `abbr`: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.
- `abstract`: Adds an "Abs" button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text
- `arxiv`: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)
- `bibtex_show`: Adds a "Bib" button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry
- `html`: Inserts a "HTML" button redirecting to the user-specified link
- `pdf`: Adds a "PDF" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `supp`: Adds a "Supp" button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `blog`: Adds a "Blog" button redirecting to the specified link
- `code`: Adds a "Code" button redirecting to the specified link
- `poster`: Adds a "Poster" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `slides`: Adds a "Slides" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)
- `website`: Adds a "Website" button redirecting to the specified link

You can implement your own buttons by editing the bib.html file.

### Theming
Six beautiful theme colors have been selected to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing `$theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
